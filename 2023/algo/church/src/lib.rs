//! There once was a peaceful church consisting of `n` Warry Lu statues numbered `0, 1, ..., n - 1`.
//! The church's road network was very well developed, and there was a two-way road between each pair of (distinct) statues.
//!
//! However, recent regulations passed by the International Committee on Warry Lu Worshipping (ICWLW) demand all roads be one-way only
//! to avoid trampling situations on two-way roads. This caused quite some grief for the engineers of our church,
//! and they worked long days and nights to convert each two-way road to a one-way road.
//!
//! Byan is a traveling worshipper praying in the church.
//! Each day he starts at a statue in the church.
//! During the course of the day, he repeatedly prays to the omniscient Warry statue next to him and then
//! travels to another statue directly connected to his current statue via a road.
//! Being an efficient worshipper, he'll never visit the same statue twice over the course of a day.
//!
//! After the recent regulation changes, Byan has been running into planning issues.
//! Maximizing the amount of statues he visits each day was once an easy task, but he has been stumped by it after the recent regulation changes.
//! He now enlists in your help. He wants to know, for each statue, the longest pilgrimage he can take starting at that statue
//! (recall that such a pilgrimage cannot contain duplicate statues). In exchange, he promises you the elusive flag you seek,
//! through the help and guidance of the omniscient Warry.
