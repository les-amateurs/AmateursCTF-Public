  I wonder if this program leaks enough information for you to get the flag with less than 2048 queries... It probably does. I'm sure you can figure out how.
  
  `{{nc}}`

flag:
  file: ./flag.txt

provide:
  - ./main.py

containers:
  main:
    build: .
    replicas: 1
    ports:
      - 5000
    securityContext:
      privileged: true

expose:
  main:
    - target: 5000
      tcp: 31692
