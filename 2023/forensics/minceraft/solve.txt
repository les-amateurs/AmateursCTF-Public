these are minecraft region files but we can run binwalk on them to reveal they are just a bunch of compressed files. uncompressing all of the files we can grep through it and find the flag, which was stored as an item on one of the cow's heads. this file was generated in 1.8.9 so the cow shouldn't appear if you loaded on a newer version, and also the item had a 0% drop rate so you were never going to get it by playing the game normally idt theres a command.
