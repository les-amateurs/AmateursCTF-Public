    I've gotten tired of everyone opening shells on my computer, so I'm increasing the size of the blocklist. I'm not sure how you got into the previous one, but you definitely can't get into this one. (Flag format is `amateursCTF{[a-zA-Z_]*}`, for any CTFers looking to social engineer an admin for the flag).

    `{{nc}}`

flag: amateursCTF{le_elite_little_tiles_let_le_light_light_le_flag_til_the_light_tiled_le_elitist_level}

provide: 
    - ./main.py

containers:
  main:
    build: .
    replicas: 1
    ports:
      - 5000
    securityContext:
      privileged: true
    limits:
      memory: 250Mi
expose:
  main:
    - target: 5000
      tcp: 31672
