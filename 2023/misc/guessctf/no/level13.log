[redacted] was planning to put [redacted] here but forgot. Go do [redacted]. 

The thing I was [redacted] to put here was aes but key=0. Too easy though, so instead [redacted]. Also the next level is pretty much [redacted] so good [redacted].

Oops I forgot that telling you the [redacted] makes the guessing [redacted]. I redacted it instead. For the record there are only 14 [redacted] so you're almost there! just gotta find one last [redacted]. If you get stuck, I'm sure social [redacted] the admins can solve it.

Anyways, I need to go [redacted] my [redacted]. Go [redacted] that password.
