So... I need an extra level. Oh here's a dumb idea. What if you *hypothetically* hid the password to this in... oh I don't know, like some random data from the previous levels or something?

Nah that would be too mean. Okok what if HYPOTHETICALLY I hid the password in plain sight. Oh i already did that. OK OK FOR REAL THIS TIME WHAT IF... the password was a permutation of ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ1234567890!@#$%^&*()abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz, in the order 4231. or something like that. Nah that would be crazy. Ok, what about this. What if I hid the password on youtube. *Plugs youtube channel link*. Please like and subscribe!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Ok but no for real what if I hid the password to this on the wayback machine. What if you took the ctf link and then like, went back in time. using a time machine. Or something. No but fr the really dumb idea would be to actually do level 11/27 this time, but like. Different. Y'know, swapping the order, byte swapping instead of hex swapping, all that stuff. Hmmmm ok but really what if the password was hidden in plain sight the whole time, in this very file. You just haven't figured it out yet. Knowing the answer really makes everything a lot easier, doesn't it. There's really no reason to go back to previous levels at this point. The only information you need is here. This will be consistent for the rest of the levels, although some of them might've been training you for the finale. I'm not sure what, but something is coming. Don't miss it.
