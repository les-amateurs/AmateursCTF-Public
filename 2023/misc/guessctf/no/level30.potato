Good job on making it here. Two more *puzzles* to solve. Wait... puzzles?
See originally I was going to do password indexing. But then I thought... "Nah, that's too similar to level 28". Which is unfortunate. idt anyone will make it here but dm HELLOPERSON#7543 if you did. DM me all the passwords from level1.zip pw to level30.zip pw. I'll give you a hint as to where the password is located. See, since you made it too far, I thought it would've been too easy for you. Anything I put here you would viciously tear down, so long as the level were computationally feasible. Looking at you, level22 which is definitely not computationally feasible. Yeah so there's just a 3 hour timewall here dm me and expect a response 3 hours later. If I forget, just remember, this level is solvable without me. The next level is hintless, and will never get hints. Good luck. Have fun. Be prepared for the worst. Don't forget to finally extract that hidden information in the levels with extra hex. Use this key: abcdef. With this key you will be able to unlock the secrets of the universe and beyond. Just don't forget to use it.
