    I heard my professor talking about some "Java Virtual Machine" and its weird gimmicks, so I took it upon myself to complete one. It wasn't even that hard? I don't know why he was complaining about it so much.

    Compiled with `openjdk 11.0.19`.

    Run with `java JVM code.jvm`.
    
flag: amateursCTF{wh4t_d0_yoU_m34n_j4v4_isnt_A_vm?}

    - ./jvm.tar.gz
    - ./code.jvm
