i've been reminded that these levels are sorely missing out on the one thing i liked most about last year's guessctf: flavortext. yeah, it's wayyy too hard without flavortext. although, my recommendation says that you could probably solve this level without... the flavortext. not even the clue, for that matter. do with that what you will.
