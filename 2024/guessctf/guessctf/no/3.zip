writing... thirty or so unique levels is quite hard. being original is quite hard. these are all supposed to be really dumb puzzles that i made that are way to vague... but we promised this year that there would be less... of certain types of puzzles and more variety. i'm afraid those will exist but they will be few and far between. SO I JUST STOLE A REV CHALLENGE LMAO!
