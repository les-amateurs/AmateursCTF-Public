!!!EYES ONLY - DESTROY AFTER READING!!!

Agent Larry,

We have received disturbing intel that the Syndicate is closing in on acquiring a cache of nuclear materials from a rogue separatist group operating in Eastern Europe. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to intercept the handoff and secure the radioactive package before it falls into the wrong hands.

The exchange is set to take place at an abandoned steel mill outside __Donetsk__ at 0300 hours on 3/26. You'll be working with assets from MI6 on the ground - contact is █████████████, callsign "Bulldog." He'll provide you with weaponry, surveillance tech, and exfil route. The secret code phrase is "amateursCTF{sp3cial_ops_agen7_larry_1nb0und}"

The Syndicate has surprisingly good intel on our ops, so maintaining opsec is critical. Your cover legend is contained in the attached dossier along with reconnaissance photos of the mill.

Once on site, your primary objective is making the handoff with Bulldog's team and getting that nuclear material into safe custody by any means necessary. The Syndicate cannot be allowed to acquire these weapons at any cost. Deadly force is authorized if engaged.

Should things go sideways, your secondary objective is to destroy or permanently deny the nuclear materials to the Syndicate. We cannot risk them gaining even partial access. Thermite Demo charges are included in your gear pack for this contingency.

One final note - we have cracked Syndicate comms and there are whispers their new lieutenant __Scarlett__ may be involved with this op. Approach with extreme caution if they surface.

Farewell. {.;,;.}
