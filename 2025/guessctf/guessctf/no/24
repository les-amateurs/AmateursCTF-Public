so much work and effort was put into the smileyctf guessctf, and it all amounted to nothing. bad ctftime rating, no one made any progress, wasted time and setup. but i still found a use for it, helping out the environment by reducing reusing and recycling. this is almost the end. will there any winners this time? who knows. but you, the solver, have one last challenge to face. go and claim your prize.
