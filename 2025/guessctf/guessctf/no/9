"The Key Beneath the Layers"

They said, "It's simple--just some math,"
But every block obscures the path.
A quiet war of byte and bit,
Where guesses fail, and patterns split.

The plaintext once was pure and clean,
Now veiled in rounds, no trace is seen.
A subtle box, a shifting scheme,
What once was real now feels a dream.

You try to trace the hidden thread,
Through tangled steps the cipher spread.
Each round, a mask—no hint, no clue,
Each XOR smirks, "I know more than you."

Columns mix, the rows all shift,
A labyrinth with no clear lift.
The key? It morphs and multiplies,
Its purpose wrapped in thin disguise.

You search for flaws--timing, mode,
A leaking edge, a cracked decode.
A byte reused, a nonce betrayed,
One fatal slip, encryption flayed.

Each test you run, each script you write,
Draws shadows closer to the light.
And when you finally glimpse the truth,
It isn't luck--it's skill, it's proof.

Now rest not yet--decode, delight,
But start with these to crack the night:
